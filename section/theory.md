# Constructive Existence Quantization Hypothesis

## Definition 1: Constructible Unit
We define a Constructible Unit (CU) as the minimal definable logical object whose existence is guaranteed by a deterministic constructive process.

## Lemma 1: Quantization of Definition
If all CU are derived from finite definitional mappings, then the space of existence is necessarily discrete and quantized.

## Theorem 1: Quantized Constructive Existence
Under the axioms of constructive quantization, any existential claim must be validated by a finite, constructive, and logically complete derivation.
